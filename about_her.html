      <p>
        My hands are shaking right now while I am writing about her. I don't
        know what I am gonna write further but the only thing I know is that
        today I just want to write. I have no guts to propose her, and I have no
        idea what to do. 😔 The only way I can explain my feelings with is "My
        words". Now this is my only option. I am gonna write just for her. ☹️
        Believing that one day she will see my this repository, and read this.
        Only that day she will know How must I liked her. 🥰 I am Now going to
        write everything For Her. What I feel for her.🥰
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p2">
      <p>You heared right. The only way I found to propose her is this. This is
        random, I have no idea if she will ever open my github profile and read my
        page. But hope keeps me alive ! 😖 <br>
        I hope she will really do it one day. <br>
        That day will come surely. Then I don't care about the result, If she
      answer yes or no. The only thing I am concerned about is that my message
      should be sent to her. As I have no guts, there is no other way, if she
      actually care about me. she will open it one day. 😢
       <br> 
<!--        <h2 style="color:red  ">  Now about her:  </h2> -->
       <br> 
       I don't have words, 😶 This is no more just a physical attraction, this is
       something of far beyond, I know I don't look good and also that I don't
       even have enough money. But that doen't mean that will stop seeing her and
       there is no way thinking that she might not like me at all. How can I
       decide it.
     </p>
       
    </div>

    <div class="p3">
    <p> I have no right to predetermine anything, I just want to be
      with her, and I wanna go through this process. Whenever I look at her, I
      know she is for me. whenever she smiles in front of me, maybe for
      anything, I smile too for no reason. 😄 She is happiness for me too.🤗</p>
      <br>
      <p> Whenever i think about her my face shine 😚 and my whole body glows.
        Yes....! 😖 I always show that i am not at all interested in her. But from
        inside I Love her. Yes !. I spelled the correct word. I love her(maybe), I
        am still not sure. How can i even decide. without talking to her, I have
        no reason to think of it but still I have some feeling that maybe I love
        her. 'Cause I care for her. I want to see her face every morning. I don't
        care where.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I become sad when she feels sad. <br>
          I become hopeless when she ignores me. <br>
          I become depressed when she doesn't reply me. <br>
          Yes! <br>
          What more i can say. See, I am not a kind of guy that have a lot of words to explaing
          this phenomenon, All I know is that I have hope. <br>
          I do not have money, I do not have enough clothes to look good enough for her. I always keep smile
          to feel good for her. I want to see her. I can forget to think of myself
          but not about her .Every morning, she comes in mind. But she doesn't
          remind me 😣. I don't know if she even know me that what am i actually .
          But sill I have hope that maybe there is some hope. <br>
          Yes..... <br>
          I want to earn for her. I want her to be with me. I want to fulfill all her needs.
          Yes! Cause I have hope. That may be this is what I have to do and this is
          the cost that i have to pay just to be with her. <br>
          I can write a whole book about her but right now I will try to stop here. My hands are not ready to
          stop yet. and mind dosn't let me stop, It says why are you stopping.... <br>
          I am sure that I will tell her everything one day .I have not met her yet. because I am
          busy with my work and family. my first priority is my family and also that
          i am doing hardwork for their happy life. I also wanted to put a song in
          it that I usually listen while thinking of her.  but it is just like a
          piece of paper of my words.... <br>
           <i> I HOPE SHE WILL READ THIS AND WILL UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS.</i> <br><br>
           I usually call myself a SOFTWARE DEVELOPER. But Today I will call myself "HER DEVELOPER" A programmer only for her. <br>
           <h2 style="color: red;">WHAT DID I DO TO MEET HER :</h2><br> 
           <p>
  So first , I do not wanted to do all these things but i did 😐, i arranged her
  sister's  phone no. and i started to communicate with her.
  but my intention was to talk with guddu 😍 in any how condition . after 2
  months i decided to tell her about guddu.I told her everything, after
  that she got shocked because she didn't expect me to do something like
  this beside i hope that she will convince guddu to talk with me ,But it
  did not happen 😥 ,she said that guddu is not interested , at that time i
  don't know how to react 😥, because i had high hopes(if you love someone
  truly you always think positive). as i was 🙂.... <br>
  yes! <br> but i was engery too,because I asked for some time .No one is so busy to meet anyone . And
  it was Guddu that she was not too busy. at that time ,that day i cried for
  a girl first time . <br>
  And i was so sad ,then i thought that i am new in this
  phase(Love). I tried to find solutions of my all problems.by the way, I
  have been alone for many years. almost 9 years (when i was 13tn). It was
  not my decision to be alone.my circumstances forced me to be alone. but
  slowly slowly ,I started liking being alone. those days were very
  difficult to me but very helpful.

             things...... i can not describe all things. <br>  you will have to do on your
             own😁.this is something about me.....🙂 <br>
             let's come to the point again... <br>  after the refusal , i continued my studies and focus on my career. But not
             a single day went by when I didn't remember her😖😖😖. She must have
             refused 😥because she didn't even know that I was in love with her🥰😘.And
             how could she have known because I had not given her any indication that i
             like her (that was biggest mistake).And I regret it. <br> <i>  But it was not my
              fault i wanted to tell her everything . there were lot of barriers . I
              would have told her everything, if she had met me? But this did not happen
              😥. And i kept dreaming about her every night. thinking about when will we
              meet😋 ? And used to wake up every morning with a hope that we would
              definitely meet one day. Whenever I was free, I would go out of the house
              once in a day. And longed to see her once 🥰🥰🥰. </i> <br>  But sometimes I wondered,
              will I ever find her or not? I wanted to end all my sorrows by hugging
              her.But I used to think that all this should not remain as my dreams. one
              more thing about me that I don't let anyone know who I really am.My one
              shortcoming is that I didn't let anyone know how much I loved her or cared
              for her. And it continued like this, then I went out for my studies.
